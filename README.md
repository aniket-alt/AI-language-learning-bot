# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š Demonstration chatbot with Streamlit, LlamaIndex and Google Gemini

Build a chatbot hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud and powered by LlamaIndex that augments Google Gemini with local documents. This repository is used in the Build Your Own AI Chatbot offered by <a href="https://library.sjsu.edu/digitalhumanities">King Library's Digital Humanities Center</a>. The original code for this chatbot is based on the chabtot described in <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/build-a-chatbot-with-custom-data-sources-powered-by-llamaindex/">this blog post.</a>

The demo chatbot is an expert on the works of author Rabindranath Tagore. Fork the repository and add your own documents to create a chatbot that focuses on a different topic.

## Overview of the App
